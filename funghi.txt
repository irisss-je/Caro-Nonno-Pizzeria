Ingredients
2 packages of mushrooms (about 500 gram) or more!
dried oregano
300 gram grated mozzarella
500 gram passata
pepper and salt to taste
all-purpose flour
2 recipes for pizza dough

Preparation -- 10 minutes + waiting time
The recipe if enough for 2 pizza's, so divide the ingredients for 1 pizza. 

Start preparing the pizza dough, make enough for 2 pizza crusts. You can also use store-bought crusts if you like. RINSE the mushrooms using a brush or paper kitchen towel.
Never rinse mushrooms with water, otherwise they will absorb the water and that way the pizza crust won't cook evenly. SLICE the mushrooms into quite thin slices and set them aside in a bowl. 

COMBINE passata and about a handful of dried oregano in the second bowl. 
Finishing the pizza funghi -- 15 minutes
PRE-HEAT the oven to 220 degrees Celsius or 430 degrees Fahrenheit. DUST your work surface and rolling-pin with flour. ROLL out the pizza dough until you've reached a round pizza.

TRANSFER the pizza to a baking tray lined with parchment paper and cover with tomato sauce. Don't cover the edges, you can easily divide the sauce using a spoon.
DIVIDE a large amount of grated mozzarella and then a layer of mushroom slices on top of the pizza dough. ADD a small handful of dried oregano on top of the pizza along with some pepper and salt. REPEAT all the steps for the second pizza.

BAKE the pizza funghi for about 10 minutes, depending on the oven and thickness of the crust. TRANSFER the pizza to a large plate and divide into slices. SERVE immediately and enjoy!
